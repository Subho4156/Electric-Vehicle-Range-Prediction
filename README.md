# ðŸ”‹ Electric Vehicle Range Prediction using Linear Regression  

This project predicts the **driving range (in kilometers)** of an electric vehicle based on its specifications such as **battery capacity, top speed, acceleration, efficiency, and more**.  

It was built as a simple machine learning project to understand data preprocessing, correlation analysis, and linear regression modeling using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview  

The goal is to build a model that can predict how far an EV can travel on a full charge (`range_km`) using its technical attributes.  

The main steps include:  
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ checking correlations between features and target.  
3. **Model Training** â€“ using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn.  
4. **Model Evaluation** â€“ calculating metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².  
5. **Prediction** â€“ using the trained model to predict the range of a new EV.
